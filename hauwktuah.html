        <h2>History of Shawarma</h2>
        <div class="history">
            <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish made from seasoned meat (usually lamb, chicken, turkey, or beef) that is cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Its roots trace back to the Ottoman Empire, where the technique of stacking seasoned meat on a vertical spit was used to create what is now known as shawarma.</p>
            <p>The name "Shawarma" comes from the Turkish word "�evireme," which means "turning" or "rotating," referring to the way the meat is cooked. The dish spread throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean, gaining popularity in countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Palestine. Shawarma became particularly known for its flavorful marinade and its ability to be served in a pita or flatbread, often with vegetables, garlic sauce, and pickles.</p>
            <p>Over time, Shawarma became an international street food, with variations in the spices, garnishes, and types of meat used. It remains one of the most beloved dishes in Middle Eastern cuisine today.</p>

        <div class="recipe">
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>500g chicken thighs or lamb/beef (cut into strips or pieces)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>1 large onion, sliced thinly</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vinegar (optional)</li>
                <li>Warm pita or flatbread for serving</li>
                <li>Fresh vegetables (tomato, cucumber, lettuce)</li>
                <li>Garlic sauce or tahini sauce for drizzling (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-list">
                <li><strong>Marinate the meat:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and yogurt. Mix well. Add the chicken (or lamb/beef) and coat the meat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for best flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the marinated meat for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and browned. If using chicken thighs, ensure the internal temperature reaches 165�F (75�C). You can also grill the meat on a barbecue for extra flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the toppings:</strong> While the meat is cooking, prepare the fresh vegetables. Slice tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce for the garnish. You can also prepare any additional toppings like pickles or onions.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the Shawarma:</strong> Warm the pita or flatbread in the skillet or microwave. Once the meat is cooked, slice it into thin strips or pieces. Place the warm bread on a plate, add the cooked meat, and top with fresh vegetables and your choice of garlic sauce or tahini sauce.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Roll up the shawarma like a wrap, or fold the sides to make a pocket, and enjoy! Shawarma is perfect for a quick meal or as a flavorful street food-style treat.</li>
