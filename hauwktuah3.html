        <h2>History of the American Cheeseburger</h2>
        <div class="history">
            <p>The cheeseburger is an iconic American dish, believed to have originated in the early 20th century. While the exact inventor is debated, many trace its roots back to the 1920s in the United States. One popular story is that a chef named Lionel Sternberger is credited with creating the first cheeseburger in 1926 at his father's restaurant, "The Rite Spot," in Pasadena, California. Sternberger allegedly placed a slice of American cheese on a hamburger, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
            <p>American cheeseburgers became a staple of American cuisine, especially after World War II when the rise of fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King spread the popularity of the cheeseburger globally. The classic American cheeseburger is typically made with a beef patty, melted American cheese, and served on a soft bun with a variety of toppings like lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and condiments like ketchup and mustard.</p>
            <p>Today, the cheeseburger is not only a fast-food favorite but also a beloved item at barbecues, diners, and restaurants around the world, often enjoyed with fries, coleslaw, or onion rings.</p>

        <h2>American Cheeseburger Recipe</h2>
        <div class="recipe">
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>500g ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat for juiciness)</li>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for grilling)</li>
                <li>1 small onion, sliced into rings</li>
                <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
                <li>4 leaves of lettuce (iceberg or romaine)</li>
                <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
                <li>Ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise (optional)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-list">
                <li><strong>Prepare the patties:</strong> Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 inch thick. Season both sides of the patties with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Preheat the grill or pan:</strong> Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill or pan to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the patties:</strong> Place the patties on the grill or in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or longer if you prefer them well-done. In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of American cheese on each patty to melt.</li>
                <li><strong>Toast the buns:</strong> While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden brown.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the cheeseburgers:</strong> Place a cooked patty with melted cheese on the bottom half of each toasted bun. Add the lettuce, tomato slice, onion rings, and pickles (if using). Top with your choice of ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise, and place the top half of the bun on top.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the cheeseburgers immediately with your favorite side, such as fries or coleslaw. Enjoy!</li>
