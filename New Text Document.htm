        <h2>History of Omu Rice</h2>
        <div class="history">
            <p>Omu Rice (オムライス, "omelette rice") is a popular Japanese comfort food that combines fried rice with a fluffy omelette on top. The dish is said to have been invented in the early 20th century, at a western-style restaurant in Tokyo, known as <i>Renga-tei</i>. It is believed to be a fusion dish that originated from Western influences but was adapted into Japanese culinary traditions. The "omu" part comes from the Japanese pronunciation of "omelette," while "rice" is self-explanatory. The dish is a favorite among both children and adults, often served in casual eateries or as homemade comfort food.</p>
            <p>Originally, the rice was made with a basic combination of chicken and vegetables, cooked in ketchup or demi-glace sauce, and topped with a soft omelette. Over time, variations have evolved, and you might find Omu Rice served with different ingredients or sauces, such as curry or brown gravy. Despite the variations, the dish remains a symbol of "Western" fusion in Japanese cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Omu Rice Recipe</h2>
        <div class="recipe">
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>1 cup cooked rice (preferably cold)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 bell pepper, chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cooked chicken breast, diced (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup peas (optional)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon milk (optional for fluffier omelette)</li>
                <li>Chopped parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-list">
                <li><strong>Prepare the rice:</strong> If you haven’t already, cook the rice and let it cool. Cold rice works best for this recipe.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the filling:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and cooked chicken (if using), and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Season the rice:</strong> Add the rice to the pan and stir to combine. Then add ketchup, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix everything well and cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated through. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the omelette:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs with the milk (if using) until well combined. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat, and pour in the egg mixture. Swirl the pan to create an even layer. Let it cook until the edges are set, but the center is still slightly runny.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the dish:</strong> Place the cooked rice in the center of the omelette. Carefully fold the omelette over the rice to form a parcel. You can either fold the edges over or just flip it onto the rice to create a half-moon shape.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish and serve:</strong> Garnish with chopped parsley if desired, and serve hot. You can drizzle extra ketchup on top for extra flavor!</li>
