            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-list">
                <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> In a bowl, combine the yogurt, half of the ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, and salt. Add the chicken cubes and mix until well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In the same pan, add butter and saut√© the chopped onion, garlic, and the remaining ginger until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the garam masala and chili powder (if using), cooking for another minute.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the butter chicken sauce:</strong> Add the crushed tomatoes and sugar to the pan. Stir well, and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes until it thickens slightly. Add the heavy cream, and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine the chicken with the sauce:</strong> Add the cooked chicken to the sauce, stirring to coat. Let it cook for another 5 minutes, ensuring the chicken is fully coated and heated through.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve the butter chicken with warm naan bread or basmati rice. Enjoy!</li>
