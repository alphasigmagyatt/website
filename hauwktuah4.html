        <h2>History of Shark Fin Soup</h2>
        <div class="history">
            <p>Shark fin soup is a traditional Chinese delicacy that has been enjoyed for centuries, particularly in Cantonese cuisine. It is often served at special occasions such as weddings, banquets, and other celebratory events, where it is considered a symbol of luxury, status, and good fortune. Shark fin soup is made with the fins of various species of shark, typically boiled in a rich broth, and often accompanied by other ingredients like chicken, ham, or mushrooms.</p>
            <p>The origins of shark fin soup can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), where it was initially considered a rare and luxurious dish among the Chinese elite. Over time, it became associated with wealth and was increasingly served at major feasts. In modern times, it is often seen as a prestigious dish in Chinese culture, especially during significant events.</p>
            <p>However, the practice of harvesting shark fins, which involves removing fins from live sharks and discarding the bodies, has sparked significant environmental concerns. In recent years, there has been growing awareness about the detrimental impact of shark finning on global shark populations, leading to bans and restrictions on the practice in several countries. As a result, many chefs and restaurants have begun to offer alternatives to shark fin soup, such as using plant-based ingredients to mimic the texture of shark fins.</p>

        <h2>Shark Fin Soup Recipe</h2>
        <div class="recipe">
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>200g dried shark fins (or substitute with imitation shark fins made from agar-agar)</li>
                <li>1 liter chicken broth</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Chinese ham or Jinhua ham, sliced thinly</li>
                <li>4-5 dried Chinese mushrooms (shiitake or wood ear), soaked and sliced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon white pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (to thicken the soup)</li>
                <li>2-3 stalks of green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil (for flavor)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-list">
                <li><strong>Prepare the shark fins:</strong> If using dried shark fins, soak them in warm water for about 6-8 hours or overnight to soften. Once softened, cut the fins into manageable pieces. If using imitation shark fins, prepare according to the package instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the broth:</strong> In a large pot, bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, white pepper, and sliced Chinese ham. Let it simmer for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the mushrooms:</strong> Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water for about 30 minutes or until softened. Once softened, slice them into thin pieces.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine the ingredients:</strong> Add the softened shark fins (or imitation shark fins) and sliced mushrooms to the simmering broth. Continue to simmer the soup for an additional 30 minutes, allowing the fins to fully rehydrate and absorb the flavors of the broth.</li>
                <li><strong>Thicken the soup:</strong> Mix the cornstarch with a little bit of water to create a slurry. Slowly pour the cornstarch mixture into the soup while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Let the soup cook for another 5-10 minutes until it thickens to a velvety consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing touches:</strong> Drizzle the sesame oil into the soup for added depth of flavor. Stir to combine. Taste the soup and adjust seasoning with additional soy sauce or white pepper if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls, and garnish with chopped green onions. Serve hot and enjoy this luxurious and traditional dish!</li>
